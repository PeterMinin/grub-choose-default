    <title>DESCRIPTION</title>

    <para><command>&dhpackage;</command> is a small GUI program which displays
    your grub entries in a menu and lets you quickly change the default
    without having to go to the command line as well as looking up the index
    of the new default.</para>

    <para>Additionally <command>&dhpackage;</command> works also under the
    certain other operating system which resembles an opening in the wall,
    since it is written in Python. Other OSes have not been tested.</para>

    <para>At this point in time it only works for legacy grub (0.xx).</para>

          <para>If used, <command>&dhpackage;</command> will show the reboot
          option, which is disabled by default.</para>
          <para>Note that this only controls the display of the reboot button,
          the actual reboot logic is outside of the scope of this program.
          Please check the included support scripts, which provide the
          functionality for some desktop environments.</para>
