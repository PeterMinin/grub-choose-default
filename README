Homepage: http://ds.mcbf.net/wiki/GrubChooseDefault

A simple GUI program to set your grub default for the next reboot. This
program only works with the "new" grub, i.e., version 1.98+.  If you are using
grub-0.9x (grub-legacy), then please use the previous v0.3 release. 

Grub-choose-default works both under Linux and Windows (see README.win32). It
should run under other Unices as well, but has not been tested (user reports
are welcome).

What it does is:
1. Display your boot menu options, highlighting the current default.
2. After clicking on one of the buttons, the new default will be saved in
   grub's environment.
3. Optionally end your session.


*****************************************************************************
* Permissions:
**************

Step 2 requires root permissions. Grub-choose-default will call:
  $ sudo grub-set-default 'New Default'
This requires an entry in sudoers with the NOPASSWD attribute. For example:
"
$user ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/grub-set-default
"
Where $user is your user name.

Running grub-choose-default as root is not recommended.


*****************************************************************************
* Session Logout:
*****************

Logging out is dependent on your desktop environment. Example scripts are
included in the reboot/ subdirectory. To use this functionality, you have to
copy the script you want to use to $XDG_CONFIG_DIR/grub-choose-default/reboot .
$XDG_CONFIG_DIR usually is ~/.config .

If anyone can come up with a script that autodetects the DE and calls the
appropriate logout command, please send me a copy and I will include it.
